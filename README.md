## About

This is a restaurant review app. It shows the restaurant details on landing page and their location on map. It is part of Udacity Front End Nanodegree and project for part 4 of nanodegree.

## What I learned?

This Project is given with redundant code and with almost zero user experience. I learned how to use redundant code usable by using some parts of it and remove the unnecessary code. 
I learned about responsive website, accessibility features than can make app accessible to screen reader users. After that I learned how making an app offline first can increase user experience.
The following things are conclusions:- 
 * How to reuse redundant code.
 * Make site responsive using bootstrap.
 * Give accessibility features using `tabindex` and `aria role`.
 * Make offline or progressive web apps using `Service Workers` and `Cache API`.
